what is PrepareStatement:(I)

	PrepareStatement(I) is a child interface of Statement which is present java.sql.package
	PrepareStatement is pre-compiled SQL statement.

	by using PS we can submit only one sql query.
	it is used to execute parametrized query
     	it can be passed paramter to sql query at runtime.
	
	how to write parameterized query
	String sql="insert into student(coloumnname1,coloumnname2,coloumnname3) values(?,?,?) ";
	we are passing paramter (?)

	why ?
	
	it improves performance better than statement.because it is precompiled.
